This is a Todo App built using Html, Css, Javascript and React.js. It allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks that you want to complete. The app has been built using modern web development techniques and follows best practices to ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.      

## Installation
To run the app locally, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't already have it, you can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the repository or download the source code as a zip file. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
npm install
```
After the dependencies are installed, start the app using the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.     

## Usage
The app has a simple and intuitive user interface. To add a task, enter it in the input field and press the "Add" button. To edit a task, click the pencil icon and make the necessary changes. To delete a task, click the trash icon.

## Technical Details
The app has been built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses React hooks to manage state and update the UI in response to user interactions. The app also uses local storage to persist the tasks across page reloads.

The code has been written in ES6 syntax and has been transpiled to ES5 using Babel to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
